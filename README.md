*   Analyze technical indicators.
*   View future price predictions generated by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model.
*   Incorporate news sentiment analysis (using GDELT, Newspaper3k, VADER) to potentially adjust predictions.
*   Interact with the plot.
*   Save the generated plot as an image.

This tool is intended for educational and informational purposes.

## Running the Executable (Windows)

Currently, a pre-built version is provided **only for Windows (64-bit)**. This executable is packaged within a `.zip` archive that contains all necessary files.

1.  **Navigate to Releases:** Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Desloo/Stock_Analyzer/releases) page of this repository. 
2.  **Download the Archive:** Find the latest release and download the `.zip` file listed under "Assets" (e.g., `StockAnalysisPC-v1.0-Windows.zip`).
3.  **Extract the Archive:** Once downloaded, **extract the entire contents** of the `.zip` file to a new folder on your computer. Do **not** try to run the executable directly from within the zip file viewer.
4.  **Open the Extracted Folder:** Navigate into the folder created during extraction (it will likely be named `Stock Analyzer` or similar, matching the folder inside the zip).
5.  **Run the Application:** Inside this folder, find and double-click the executable file named `Stock Analyzer.exe` (or similar application name) to launch the program.

*(This executable is built for Windows and will **not** run on macOS or Linux. To run on other platforms, please follow the "Running from Source Code" instructions.)*
